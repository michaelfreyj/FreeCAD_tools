# FreeCAD Tools
Repo for all my freecad toolbit files


Relative paths don't work yet so the libraries won't work between computers... and also the bits work work between computers...

laptop and desktop tools dir is /home/mfrey/CNC/FreeCAD_tools/ so everything will work between those. But the work computer throws a wrench in all this other stuff so it will have to be excluded...


## To-Do

- [ ] Create an install script that puts the shapes, toolbits, and libraries in a user specified location
  - [ ] Installs shapes to a user specified location
  - [ ] Creates toolbits from a tool library in a spreadsheet, csv file, or YAML
  - [ ] Updates the afforementioned items with any new or changed content
- [ ] Include python TUI speeds and feeds calculator for various materials?
